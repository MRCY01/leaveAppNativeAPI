LOOSE DECOUPLING
    - By having a constructor, we can avoid the direct dependency within 2 classes
    - This can help so that any changes of class B in class A will not affect the original class

DI(Dependency Injection)
    -Spring uses dependency injection to wire the beans together. 
    - When one bean depends on another bean, Spring will inject the dependent bean into the dependent class. 
    - This can be done through 
        constructor injection, 
        setter injection, or 
        field injection (using @Autowired)
    
INSTANTIATED
    - creating a new Object in the heap memory
    - Example: using 'new' keyword
